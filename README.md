*Janus* is an open-source Android app that provides contextual word and concept translations by leveraging the vast, human-curated knowledge graph of Wikipedia.

[![CI](https://github.com/AnySoftKeyboard/janus/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/AnySoftKeyboard/janus/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
Instead of literal machine translation, it finds the corresponding Wikipedia article in the target language to offer a more accurate and context-aware translation.

## Main Features
* Contextual Translation: Uses Wikipedia article titles for accurate, context-aware translations.
* Multi-Language Support: Translate from any Wikipedia-supported language to any other, or to all at once.
* Rich Information: Displays the short description of articles for added context.
* Full History & Bookmarks: Keeps a chronological log of all translations and allows you to save important ones to a dedicated screen.
& Modern UI: A clean, intuitive interface built with Jetpack Compose, supporting both light and dark themes.
* Intuitive Controls: Simple "Swipe-to-Delete" gestures and a "Multi-select" mode for easy history management.
